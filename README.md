# SQL Final Project – US Dairy Production Analysis

This project showcases data analysis using MySQL on agricultural production datasets, focusing primarily on dairy products such as cheese, yogurt, milk, eggs, and honey across various US states.

The data was sourced from USDA reports and includes production volumes for different commodities from 2022 to 2023. The project involves creating structured SQL tables, cleaning and transforming data (e.g., removing commas from large numbers), and writing analytical queries to extract insights.

## Objectives
- Import and manage real-world CSV data in MySQL
- Clean raw data and convert it into usable formats (e.g., numeric columns)
- Perform meaningful queries to answer specific questions such as:
  - Total milk production for 2023
  - States with cheese production over 100 million in a given month
  - Yogurt production in states that also produced cheese
- Demonstrate practical SQL skills: JOINs, subqueries, aggregations, filtering

## Tools Used
- MySQL Server 8.0
- MySQL Workbench / CLI
- Git & GitHub
- CSV (raw data format)
